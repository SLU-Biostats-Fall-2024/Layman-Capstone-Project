## Preliminary Data Analysis- Linear Regression

CAPDAP "Rough Draft" Project 11/22/2024

Workflow model: plot data (and guess the results) → build the statistical model → Check the model assumptions → Interpret the model → Make a final plot

start with a clean environment and package installation

```{r}
rm (list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(ggfortify)
library(multcomp)
```

read in the data

```{r}
WC<- read.csv(here("data", "CAPDAP_WC_4Analysis.csv"))
```

let's alter the data types

```{r}
WC$Site_Type <- as.factor(WC$Site_Type)
WC$Date<-ymd(WC$Date)
WC$Time<-hms(WC$Time)
```

now i'll build my statistical model for a cyclical time series analysis

check model assumptions

run statistical model + interpret the model/relationships

replot the model to show key relationships
